Tampermonkey OWA Reminder Notification
======================================

This is a Tampermonkey script to output notifications on Outlook Web Access
reminders, such as reminders for meetings.

When using Outlook Web Access in the browser, meeting reminders do not popup
and are easily missed.

This checks for new reminders and outputs Growl-like notifications when they
appear on the OWA tab.
